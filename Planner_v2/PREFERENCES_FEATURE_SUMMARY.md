# Preferences Collection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive preferences collection workflow that integrates seamlessly with the existing availability confirmation system.

## New Flow
1. **Guest receives availability request** (unchanged)
2. **Guest responds with availability** 
3. **Bot confirms availability** with options: "1. Confirm availability" / "2. Change availability"
4. **If guest confirms** → Bot requests preferences
5. **Guest provides preferences**
6. **Bot shows final confirmation** with availability + preferences and 3 options:
   - 1. Send availability
   - 2. Change availability  
   - 3. Change preferences
7. **Guest chooses option 1** → Complete, enhanced planner notification sent

## Database Changes
- Added `preferences` (TEXT) field to Guest model
- Added `preferences_provided` (BOOLEAN) field to Guest model
- Created migration script: `add_preferences_migration.py`

## Code Changes

### 1. Guest Model (`app/models/guest.py`)
- Added preferences fields
- Updated imports to include Text type

### 2. Guest Management Service (`app/services/guest_management_service.py`)
- Updated guest creation to include `preferences_provided=False`

### 3. Guest Availability Handler (`app/handlers/guest_availability_handler.py`)
- **Modified existing confirmation**: Changed "Send Availability" to "Confirm Availability"
- **Added preferences state handling**: `awaiting_preferences` state
- **Added new handler methods**:
  - `_handle_confirm_availability()` - Sends preferences request
  - `_handle_preferences_response()` - Processes preferences and shows final confirmation
  - `_handle_send_final_availability()` - Completes workflow with enhanced notification
  - `_handle_change_availability_final()` - Allows availability changes from final confirmation
  - `_handle_change_preferences()` - Allows preferences changes from final confirmation
  - `_send_enhanced_planner_notification()` - Includes preferences in planner notifications

### 4. Enhanced Menu System
- **Step 3**: "1. Confirm availability / 2. Change availability"
- **Step 6**: "1. Send availability / 2. Change availability / 3. Change preferences"

## Message Examples

### Availability Confirmation
```
Got it! Here's what I recorded:

📅 Your availability:
- Friday 2pm-6pm
- Saturday all day

1. Confirm availability
2. Change availability
```

### Preferences Request
```
Perfect! One more quick question:

Any preferences for the hangout? For example:
- "Let's do something outdoors"
- "I'd prefer somewhere quiet to chat"  
- "I'm up for anything!"
- "No preferences"

Just reply with your thoughts! 💭
```

### Final Confirmation
```
Perfect! Here's your complete response:

📅 Your availability:
- Friday 2pm-6pm
- Saturday all day

💭 Your preferences:
"Let's do something outdoors, maybe a park!"

1. Send availability
2. Change availability
3. Change preferences
```

### Enhanced Planner Notification
```
✅ Sarah has provided their availability:
- Friday 2pm-6pm
- Saturday all day

💭 Preferences: "Let's do something outdoors, maybe a park!"

📊 2/3 guests have responded
⏳ Waiting for 1 more guest

## Key Benefits
1. **User-Friendly**: Maintains familiar confirmation system while adding preferences
2. **Flexible**: Guests can change either availability or preferences at final step
3. **Informative**: Planners get actionable preference information for better event planning
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing events in progress won't be disrupted

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Database model updates
- ✅ Handler logic implementation
- ✅ Message templates
- ✅ Enhanced notifications
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Syntax validation

## Next Steps
1. **Test in development environment** with real database
2. **Deploy to Railway** with database migration
3. **Monitor user interactions** for any edge cases
4. **Consider adding**: Preference categories, preference validation, preference templates
